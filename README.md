# voiceRemote

I built this remote for someone I was helping with Multiple Sclerosis. MS had affected his legs, vision, and dexterity such that he needed remote controls to use the things around him, but he was having difficulty seeing and pressing the buttons on those remotes. There are options for the two designs we tried out. Depending on the user, one or the other may be a better fit.
